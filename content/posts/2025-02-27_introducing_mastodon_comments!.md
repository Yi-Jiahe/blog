I've been planning to add comments to my blog for a long time.
For the longest time now, I've just been posting to the void, not knowing if I missed anyone.

I didn't like Disqus and storing comments in GitHub issues didn't make sense to me.
However, a recent wave of Hackernews articles about online discussions and a post about using Mastodon for comments have inspired me to explore that approach.
I like the idea of using a social media platform as a comments section because it feels like a place where discussions would organically take place.

Requiring a Mastodon account to comment is both a positive and negative point in my opinion.
On one hand, it introduces friction in commenting, reducing engagement.
On the other, it might also serve as a preliminary form of moderation because that's a manual job I don't feel like undertaking.

Now Dear Reader,

I propose to you a call to action:
If this anything on this blog has caught your interest, please leave a comment and share it if you can.

Its would be nice to know that I'm not just talking to the void.
