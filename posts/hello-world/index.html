I was quickly turned away by the monthly costs however and decided to look for something else as I&rsquo;m still at that point in time where I have much more time than money. I turned to GitHub Pages because it&rsquo;s what I used for my portfolio, but I wanted to see if I could do a bit more.</p><p>Therefore, I took a look at static site generators starting from Jerkyll as it is supported by GitHub pages. Unfortunately it is not officially supported for Windows which is what I use on a day to day basis and I wanted to perform the builds on my side for testing and more transparency into the process I suppose. I decided to go with Hugo because it was one of the more popular options with supposedly really quick generation times as compared to options like Next.js which I deemed overkill for a blog. While not much of a challenge, looking for a theme which fit my tastes took quite a bit of time too, but I&rsquo;m quite satisified with what I picked. I also had to install the extended version in order to run it but that wasn&rsquo;t too much trouble and I think it might pay off later on anyway.</p><p>With a quick google I found a GitHub workflow which built my source and uploaded it to the gh-pages branch and my blog was up. For easier access I then wanted to setup a custom domain name, but I had a lot of clarifications to be made about domains. A lot of trial and error, consulations and info dumps later, I had my subdomain, <a href=http://blog.jiahe.dev target=_blank>http://blog.jiahe.dev</a> which you can use if you made it here by some other means, setup.</p><p>Long story short, there was quite a bit of configuration and messing around involved in the setup of this blog but I picked up a couple of new tools and learnt about domains, registries, DNS and DNS resolvers in the process.</p></div></article></div><aside class="col-12 col-md-3 float-left sidebar"><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-pages"><h3>Pages</h3><ul></ul></div><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></div><div class=btn><div class=btn-menu id=btn-menu><i class="iconfont icon-grid-sharp"></i></div><div class=btn-toggle-mode><i class="iconfont icon-contrast-sharp"></i></div><div class=btn-scroll-top><i class="iconfont icon-chevron-up-circle-sharp"></i></div></div><aside class=sidebar-mobile style=display:none><div class=sidebar-wrapper><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-pages"><h3>Pages</h3><ul></ul></div><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-links"><h3>Links</h3><ul></ul></div><div class="sidebar-item sidebar-tags"><h3>Tags</h3><div><span><a href=/tags/audio/>Audio</a>
