This first post covers the process of creating the blog while the next will explain my rationale for creating the blog.
So, I started off looking at some popular options for webpage design and hosting like Wix and Wordpress, especially because I had heard things about how popular Wordpress was and figured it was a good skill to learn.</description></item></channel></rss>
