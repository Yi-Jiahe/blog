However, projects are never smooth sailing and some ideas have never seen the light of day. This blog is made for such projects, to document their progress regardless and for me to share my thoughts.
On that note, a couple of long running projects I have had which are receiving my attention at the moment are my audio effects platform and drone development and simulation project.</description></item></channel></rss>
