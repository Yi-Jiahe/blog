My printer, however, is seldom used and poorly maintained so I wanted to modify the model to increase the chances of it printing successfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="design">Design&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Scott kindly shared the &lt;a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/615378#profileId-538769" target="_blank">models&lt;/a> for non-commercial use.
Because the files were not in an easily editable format, I created a new editable CAD &lt;a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/088aba448095a55b0cefb778/w/61f07337c3a206c3a56a4a47/e/3ef5bf1044b6f81334bc4e6d" target="_blank">document&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main thing I wanted to change was the amount of plastic required for the print.
While this detracted completely from the point of the original build, the original design didn&amp;rsquo;t really appeal to me anyway.
To do so I shortened the dock and removed the enclosure, removing the need for all the infill.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
