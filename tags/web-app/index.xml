Its often rate limited, or charged by the number of API calls. On top of that, one needs to be on top of things to understand what they mean. In order to get my toes wet, I decided to explore the GW2 API and the BLTC, or in-game aution house to get some practical experience on how quantitative analysis and markets work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/Yi-Jiahe/gw2-market-analysis" target="_blank">GW2 Market Analysis&lt;/a> is a Java application which scrapes the market every 12 hours to avoid aliasing, assuming that there exists periodic market fluctations with a period of one day. v0.1.0 of the application was completed in late August/ early September and implemented the scraper and database, such that there would be data for me to work with in the future. I set up a Lightsail instance to host the database and used a Systemd timer and service to schedule the scraper to run and store its results. I made use of the JDBC API to interact with my MySQL database on the machine.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
